This uses Euler-Lagrange beam theory for fixed ends and cantilever beams to calculate the flexural resonance freqency of a work piece in a lathe.
Uses compose for GUI


Future steps is implementing Timoschenko beam theroy for more accurate calculation of beam frequencies, and an About page. The application has also not been published on the google play store, due to not having gone thorugh mandatory beta testing.
